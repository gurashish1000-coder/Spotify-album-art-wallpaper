# Spotify-album-art-wallpaper
This is a python script that will change your desktop wallpaper based on the track you are listening to. Works with Spotify.

# Required Steps
In BETA
1. There are still many bugs present, that I am still working on
2. Script only works while the song is already running on spotify. (Will be fixed soon)
3. I still have to do extensive testing. (Testing that spans many hours, to see if the code breaks.)
4. Working on making it more user convenient. 

## Required Steps

- Before you run, you will need to edit the code at line 8,9 and 10. You will need to enter your own spotify client ID, spotify Client secrert and username.  

  
## How to RUN
  
- If on Linux you will need to have python installed, and pip as well. The steps are given below. 

- You will need to have python 3 installed. If you have not installed that, you can using this command

  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python3.6
  ```

- You can check if python is installed using:

  ```
  python3 --version
  ```

- After this you will also have to install pip python utility in Linux. This is because the project uses some external libraries that an be  only installed through pip. You can do that using the command below.

  ```
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  ```
- Now you can run the script with command.

  ```
  python3 wallpaper_change.py
  ```
